// Isyana is given the number of visitors at her local theme park on N consecutive days. 
//The number of visitors on the i-th day is V. A day is record breaking if it satisfies both of the following
// conditions:
// â€¢ The number of visitors on the day is strictly larger than the number of visitors on each 
//of the previous days.
// Either it is the last day, or the number of visitors on the day is strictly 
//larger than the number of visitors on the following day.
// Note that the very first day could be a record breaking day!
// Please help Isyana find out the number of record breaking days.
